Texas Imperial Software, maker of WFTPD Server, is proud to announce the release
of WFTPD Pro Server version 3.25 for Microsoft Windows.  WFTPD Pro Server has

since 1993, including:

  the internet RFCs 959 and 1123.  Implementation of many features proposed
  in draft RFCs (SIZE, MDTM, STREAM-based resume, new security features, etc)
+ Can be run on non-standard ports, on any or all IP addresses in use.
+ Access to UNC-based remote file names, and to shortcut links (LNK files).
  
+ Individually enable / disable anonymous access, anonymous uploads or all
  uploads.

  "Magic Cookies" (e.g. "Hello Eric, the time is now 12:35:10 - thank you for
  logging in from site fish.example.com")
+ Configurable maximum number of connected users and time-out on idle
  connections

+ Permit access based on user-name/password, and user's host/network
  address.
+ Rights assigned on a per-user, per-directory basis
+ Encrypted password database, using Unix standard encryption
+ Users can be restricted to their home directory and below (chroot), or
  allowed to access other drives and directories.

In addition, WFTPD Pro Server includes the following exciting new features:

+ Supports authentication and encryption using the Internet standard
  security protocols SSL and TLS.

  speed, security and stability - has been in use at thousands of sites for

  as its own native format.

  look
+ File conversions may be specified - e.g. allowing a user to fetch a file
  as a ZIP file, without having to store it as a ZIP file.
