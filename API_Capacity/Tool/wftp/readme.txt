This distribution contains the following files:

    WFTPD.HLP     - the help file that goes with this program.
   README.TXT     - that should be this file.
 WFTPD325.TXT     - A file briefly describing the features of WFTPD.
  FILE_ID.DIZ     - Short text note of WFTPD's purpose for BBS, etc
 WFTPDPRO.TXT     - Announcement of WFTPD Pro, for Windows NT.
    WSFAQ.TXT     - Frequently Asked Questions on the alt.winsock newsgroup.
    CRYPT.EXE     - A program for creating WFTPD-style passwords.
    WFTPD.EXE     - the executable program itself.

Brief installation instructions:
1. Decide where to install WFTPD Server.
2. Select the appropriate components to install:
   WFTPD.HLP   - the help file
   WFTPD.EXE   - the executable file.
3. Copy these two files (WFTPD.*) to your installation directory
4. The other files are ancillary text files.  Read them and decide
   whether you want to keep them with your WFTPD installation.  They
   are not required for WFTPD, but may provide useful information.

The registration/ordering instructions and order form are included in
the WFTPD.HLP file.  Please also read the file WFTPDPRO.TXT for
information on WFTPD Pro, the "next generation" of FTP servers for
Windows from Texas Imperial Software.
Registration of WFTPD lifts the restrictions placed on editing the
greeting and farewell messages, as well as the limit on the number of
transfers per session.  Registered users with current email addresses
are placed in a mailing list, and kept apprised of new work on WFTPD
and WFTPD Pro.  In a less tangible benefit, each new user is further
encouragement to us to continue work on WFTPD, WFTPD Pro and other
programs.  And, of course, we are more likely to implement requests for 
features from our registered users.

The WFTPD.HLP file is also where all the documentation resides.  To
run it without running WFTPD, use the standard Windows Help, and
use File|Open to open this help file.  On most installations, you
may simply use Start|Run in Windows, and enter the path of
the help file.  Please read the help file before running, and for the
answers to most of the questions that have already been asked.

If you have any questions about this program, please direct your comments 
to Deborah Jones, at "info@texis.com", or at 23921 57th Ave SE, 
Woodinville, WA 98072, USA.  Faxes and phone calls are also
accepted at (425) 806 1787.  If you have any complaints, bug-reports,
etc, please address them to us privately, and wait for a response,
before complaining publicly.  We obviously choose this policy to
protect ourselves, but also to protect our users - there is nothing so
embarrassing, surely, as complaining publicly about a problem, and then
seeing just as public a response from us saying "It's in the
instructions," or "You're running an old version," etc.  The success of
future shareware depends on your encouragement.

Thank you for caring,

Alun.
